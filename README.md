## Branches

You can think of a Git branch as a copy of the project at a specific point in time that can be changed independently of other branches ([source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/practical-git-and-git-workflows/#git-branches)).

- main/master
- production
- dev
- test

## git commands
- `git clone`
- `git status .`
- `git remote -v`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m comments`
- `git log`
- `git push`
- `git push --set-upstream origin branch`
- `git checkout -b branch`
- `git checkout branch`
- `git pull`
